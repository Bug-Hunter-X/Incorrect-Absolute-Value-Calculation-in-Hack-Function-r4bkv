This repository contains a simple Hack function with a bug related to absolute value calculation. The function `foo` aims to return the absolute value of an integer input. However, it incorrectly returns -1 for negative inputs.  The `bug.hack` file shows the buggy implementation, and `bugSolution.hack` provides a corrected version.  This example demonstrates a common type of off-by-one error in handling conditional logic.
